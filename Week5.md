Week 5 - Field Trial Instructions
This week, we use a pre-built application that automatically runs a suite of tests, sending 0, 1, 2, or 3 flows on the Low Latency service flow and a corresponding 3, 2, 1, 0 flows on the classic queeue.  The results are bundled and sent to a remote server for analysis.   

This test only applies if you have a Mac running IOS 13(Ventura) or IOS 140/14.1(Sonoma). Without this platform/relase you can skip this weekâ€™s formal tests.
